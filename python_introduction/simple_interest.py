# Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

# Define values
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

# Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Display result
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
